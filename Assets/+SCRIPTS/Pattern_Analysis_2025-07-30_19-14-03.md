# Pattern Detection and Analysis (2025-07-30 19:14:03)

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the design patterns, anti-patterns, and architectural decisions within the Gangsta Bean 3 codebase. The codebase demonstrates mature use of several established patterns while maintaining Unity-specific considerations.

## Design Patterns Observed

**Singleton Pattern**:
- Implemented through the `Singleton<T>` class in various managers such as `GameManager`.
- Ensures a single instance of core objects like `GameManager`.

**Service Pattern**:
- Utilized by `ServiceUser` class to provide access to various services like `PlayerStatsManager`, utilizing `ServiceLocator`.

**State Pattern**:
- Used in `State<T>` and `StateMachine<T>`, particularly for managing AI states (`AggroState`, etc.).

**Observer Pattern**:
- Events are extensively used for decoupling components and providing notifications through attributes like `event Action<>()` in the `Life` class and elsewhere.

**Strategy/Command Patterns**:
- Represented by the `IDoableActivity` interface, allowing flexible behavior assignment to characters.

## Key Observations

- **Modular and Decoupled**: The use of interfaces and event-driven patterns promotes modular and decoupled code.
- **Extensive Event System**: Provides a highly flexible system for handling state changes and interactions across objects.

## Potential Improvements

- **Centralize Service Management**: More comprehensive documentation or conventions for service usage would be beneficial.
- **Consistent Use of Observables**: Potential to unify observables handling to ensure consistent behavior across systems.
- **Enhance Patterns with Documentation**: Better inline comments and documentation can make both existing and new patterns easier to understand and implement.
