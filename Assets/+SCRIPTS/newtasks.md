# Learning Direction

## Primary Goal: Learning C# Best Practices Through Code Review
The main objective is to gain deep understanding of C# coding standards, patterns, and best practices by analyzing and reviewing existing code. This includes examining code structure, naming conventions, error handling, and overall code quality.

## Secondary Goal: Understanding Unity-Specific Patterns and Architecture
Develop comprehensive knowledge of Unity's unique architectural patterns, including:
- GameObject and Component systems
- Unity's event system and lifecycle methods
- Asset management and serialization
- Performance optimization techniques specific to Unity
- Unity-specific design patterns (e.g., Object Pooling, Singleton patterns in Unity context)

## Focus Area: Game Architecture and Design Patterns in the Context of Gangsta Bean 3
Concentrate on understanding how game architecture principles and design patterns are applied in Gangsta Bean 3:
- Game state management systems
- Player controller architecture
- Enemy AI and behavior patterns
- UI/UX implementation patterns
- Audio system architecture
- Save/Load system design
- Multiplayer architecture (if applicable)
- Event-driven programming in game context

# Learning Direction: Autonomous Task Execution

## Instructions for Autonomous Task Execution

This document contains a series of tasks designed to be executed autonomously. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Read each task carefully** before beginning execution
2. **Complete tasks in order** unless otherwise specified
3. **Document your approach** for each task in the completion notes
4. **Test your solutions** before marking tasks as complete
5. **Ask for clarification** if a task seems ambiguous
6. **Maintain code quality** throughout all implementations

## Task List

### 1. Environment Setup
Set up a development environment with necessary tools and dependencies for the project.

### 2. Create Project Structure
Initialize a well-organized project directory structure with appropriate folders for source code, tests, documentation, and configuration.

### 3. Implement Basic Logging System
Create a simple logging utility that can write to both console and file with different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

### 4. Design Configuration Manager
Build a configuration management system that can read settings from environment variables and configuration files.

### 5. Create Unit Test Framework
Set up a basic unit testing framework and write example tests for existing functionality.

### 6. Implement Error Handling
Design and implement a comprehensive error handling strategy with custom error types and proper error propagation.

### 7. Build CLI Interface
Create a command-line interface for interacting with the application, including help documentation and argument parsing.

### 8. Add Data Validation
Implement input validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity throughout the application.

### 9. Create Documentation Template
Set up automated documentation generation and create templates for API documentation.

### 10. Implement Caching Layer
Design and build a simple caching mechanism to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

### 11. Add Performance Monitoring
Integrate basic performance monitoring to track execution times and resource usage.

### 12. Build Integration Tests
Create integration tests that verify the interaction between different components of the system.

### 13. Implement Security Features
Add basic security features including input sanitization and secure credential handling.

### 14. Create Deployment Scripts
Write scripts to automate the deployment process for different environments (development, staging, production).

### 15. Generate Final Report
Compile a comprehensive report documenting all implemented features, design decisions, and lessons learned.

## Task Completion Tracking System

Use the following format to track task completion:

### Task Status Legend:
- ‚¨ú Not Started
- üü® In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- ‚ùå Blocked

### Completion Tracker:
