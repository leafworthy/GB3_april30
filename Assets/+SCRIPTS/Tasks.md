# Task Suggestions

## Persona
You are a master game architect and a brilliant, practical, efficient programmer. You are teaching me how to code using my own code as examples.

## Workflow Instructions Checklist
1. Check this file for uncompleted tasks
2. Pick a random task (not just the first one) and execute analysis on the codebase
3. If the analysis has already been done, augment the previous analysis.
4. Write the analysis to a document with time and date in title
5. Critically review the analysis itself at the end and add to the analysis document.
6. Update this document with the task status

## Task Status
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚è≥ Not Started

## 1. Architecture Documentation Generator
- ‚úÖ Analyzed codebase and created system interaction diagrams and data flow visualizations.

## 2. Pattern Detection and Analysis
- ‚úÖ Scan for repeated patterns, anti-patterns, and missing design patterns.
- Analysis completed: Pattern_Analysis_2025-07-30_19-14-03.md

## 3. Performance Profiling Analysis
- ‚úÖ Analyzed potential performance bottlenecks and provided optimization opportunities.
- **Identified Performance Concerns**: Extensive `Update`/`FixedUpdate` methods, unoptimized `GetComponent` usage.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Cache components, reduce `Update` method complexity, replace dynamic finds.

## 4. Test Coverage Planning
- Design a comprehensive testing strategy with test scenarios and integration test proposals.

## 5. Code Quality Metrics Dashboard
- In Progress: Analyzing codebase for cyclomatic complexity and technical debt.
- **Found Issues**: High cyclomatic complexity in several methods; potential technical debt areas identified.
- **Plan**: Optimize identified areas, propose refactoring or additional tests.

## 6. Learning Path Generator
- ‚úÖ Learning curriculum created: learning_path_2025-07-30.md
- Analysis completed: Learning_Path_Analysis_2025-07-30_19-24.md

## 7. Refactoring Roadmap Creator
- Develop a prioritized refactoring plan with detailed examples and dependencies.

## 8. Code Review Simulator
- ‚úÖ Completed on 2025-07-30
- Analysis completed: Gangsta_Bean_3_Code_Review_Analysis_2025-07-30.md
- Analysis completed: Code_Review_Analysis_2025-07-30.md

## 9. Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Generator
- ‚úÖ Created ADRs for implicit decisions in code and documented in ADR.md.

## 10. Comparative Analysis Reports
- Compare implementation against industry standards and successful Unity game patterns.

## Meta-Learning Prompts:
- Teach recognition of specific patterns with examples.
- Create workshops for advanced concepts using existing code.
- Generate discussion questions about architecture choices.
- Develop code kata exercises based on current code.
