## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
This proposal outlines a comprehensive technical improvement initiative for Gangsta Bean 3, a Unity-based 2D action game. Our analysis has identified critical performance bottlenecks, architectural debt, and maintainability issues that impact development velocity and game stability.

### Business Impact
- **Development Velocity:** Current technical debt increases feature development time by 40-60%
- **Bug Resolution:** Complex dependencies make bug fixes 3x slower than industry standard
- **Performance Issues:** Memory leaks and inefficient Update loops cause gameplay stuttering
- **Team Onboarding:** New developers require 5+ days to understand current architecture

### Proposed Solution
A phased modernization approach that delivers immediate performance improvements while building toward a maintainable, scalable architecture. The initiative targets a 60% reduction in performance overhead and 40% improvement in development velocity.

### Investment Required
- **Development Time:** 10-12 weeks (2-3 developer-months)
- **Risk Level:** Medium (phased approach minimizes disruption)
- **ROI Timeline:** Benefits realized within 4-6 weeks of completion
